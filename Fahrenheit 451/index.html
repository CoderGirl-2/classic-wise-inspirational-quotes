  <h3 id="myText">"Number one: Do you know why books such as this are so important? Because
they have quality. And what does the word quality mean? To me it means texture.
This book has pores. It has features. This book can go under the microscope.
You’d find life under the glass, streaming past in infinite profusion. The more
pores, the more truthfully recorded details of life per square inch you can get on a
sheet of paper, the more ‘literary’ you are. That’s my definition, anyway. Telling
detail. Fresh detail. The good writers touch life often. The mediocre ones run a
quick hand over her. The bad ones rape her and leave her for the flies." </h3></div>

  <h3 id="myText">"“Everyone must leave something
behind when he dies, my grandfather said. A child or a book or a painting or a
house or a wall built or a pair of shoes made. Or a garden planted. Something
your hand touched some way so your soul has somewhere to go when you die, and
when people look at that tree or that flower you planted, you’re there. It doesn’t
matter what you do, he said, so long as you change something from the way it was
before you touched it into something that’s like you after you take your hands
away. The difference between the man who just cuts lawns and a real gardener is
in the touching, he said. The lawn-cutter might just as well not have been there at
all; the gardener will be there a lifetime." </h3></div>
