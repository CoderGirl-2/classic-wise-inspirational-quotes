  <h3 id="myText">"And yet all loneliness, angers, hatreds, envies and itchings that it contains, if rolled into one single
experience and put into the scale against the least moment of the joy that is felt by the least in
Heaven, would have no weight that could be registered at all. Bad cannot succeed even in being
bad as truly as good is good. If all Hell's miseries together entered the consciousness of yon wee
yellow bird on the bough there, they would be swallowed up without trace, as if one drop of ink
had been dropped into that Great Ocean to which your terrestrial Pacific itself is only a molecule." </h3></div>
