  <h3>"Art also has its morality, and many of the rules of this morality
the same as, or at least analogous to, the rules of ordinary ethics.
Remorse, for example, is as undesirable in relation to our bad art as
it is in relation to our bad behaviour. The badness should be hunted
out, acknowledged and, if possible, avoided in the future. To pore
over the literary shortcomings of twenty years ago, to attempt to
patch a faulty work into the perfection it missed at its first execution, to spend one's middle age in trying to mend the artistic sins
committed and bequeathed by that different person who was oneself in youth-all this is surely vain and futile. And that is why this
new Brave New World is the same as the old one. Its defects as a work
of art are considerable; but in order to correct them I should have to
rewrite the book—and in the process of rewriting, as an older, other
person, I should probably get rid not only of some of the faults of
the story, but also of such merits as it originally possessed. And so, resisting the temptation to wallow in artistic remorse, I prefer to
leave both well and ill alone and to think about something else." </h3></div>

And the dictator (unless he needs cannon fodder and families with which to colonize empty or conquered territories) will do well to encourage that freedom. In conjunction with the freedom to daydream under the influence of dope and movies and the radio, it will help to reconcile his subjects to the servitude which is their fate." </h3></div>

Gotama and Jesus? Whisk-and those specks of antique dirt called

the singing words seemed to change their tone. They had mocked him through his
misery and remorse, mocked him with how hideous a note of cynical derision!
Fiendishly laughing, they had insisted on the low squalor, the nauseous ugliness of
the nightmare. Now, suddenly, they trumpeted a call to arms. "O brave new world!"
Miranda was proclaiming the possibility of loveliness, the possibility of transforming
