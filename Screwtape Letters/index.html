  <h3>"Keep his mind on the inner life. He thinks his conversion is something inside him
and his attention is therefore chiefly turned at present to the states of his own mind —
or rather to that very expurgated version of them which is all you should allow him to
see. Encourage this. Keep his mind off the most elementary duties by directing it to
the most advanced and spiritual ones." </h3></div>

  <h3>" In a word, the Future is, of all things, the thing least like eternity. It is the
most completely temporal part of time — for the Past is frozen and no longer flows,
and the Present is all lit up with eternal rays. Hence the encouragement we have given
to all those schemes of thought such as Creative Evolution, Scientific Humanism, or
Communism, which fix men's affections on the Future, on the very core of temporality.
Hence nearly all vices are rooted in the future. Gratitude looks to the past and love to
the present; fear, avarice, lust, and ambition look ahead. Do not think lust an exception.
When the present pleasure arrives, the sin (which alone interests us) is already over. " </h3></div>

  <h3>"The Enemy's demand on humans takes the form of a dilemma; either complete
abstinence or unmitigated monogamy. Ever since our Father's first great victory, we
have rendered the former very difficult to them. The latter, for the last few centuries,
we have been closing as a way of escape. We have done this through the poets and
novelists by persuading he humans that a curious, and usually short-lived, experience
which they call “being in love” is the only respectable ground for marriage; that
marriage can, and ought to, render this excitement permanent; and that a marriage
which does not do so is no longer binding. This idea is our parody of an idea that came
from the Enemy." </h3></div>

  <h3>"But in the intellectual climate which we have at last succeeded in
producing throughout Western Europe, you needn't bother about that. Only the
learned read old books and we have now so dealt with the learned that they are of all
men the least likely to acquire wisdom by doing so. We have done this by inculcating
The Historical Point of View. The Historical Point of View, put briefly, means that when
a learned man is presented with any statement in an ancient author, the one question
he never asks is whether it is true...To regard the
ancient writer as a possible source of knowledge — to anticipate that what he said
could possibly modify your thoughts or your behaviour — this would be rejected as
unutterably simple-minded. " </h3></div>

  <h3>"You see, it is so hard for these creatures to persevere. The routine of adversity, the
gradual decay of youthful loves and youthful hopes, the quiet despair (hardly felt as
pain) of ever overcoming the chronic temptations with which we have again and again
defeated them, the drabness which we create in their lives and the inarticulate
resentment with which we teach them to respond to it — all this provides admirable
opportunities of wearing out a soul by attrition." </h3></div>
