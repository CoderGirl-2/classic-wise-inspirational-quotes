  <h3 id="myText">"Art also has its morality, and many of the rules of this morality
the same as, or at least analogous to, the rules of ordinary ethics.
Remorse, for example, is as undesirable in relation to our bad art as
it is in relation to our bad behaviour. The badness should be hunted
out, acknowledged and, if possible, avoided in the future. To pore
over the literary shortcomings of twenty years ago, to attempt to
patch a faulty work into the perfection it missed at its first execu-
tion, to spend one's middle age in trying to mend the artistic sins
committed and bequeathed by that different person who was one-
self in youth-all this is surely vain and futile. And that is why this
new Brave New World is the same as the old one. Its defects as a work
of art are considerable; but in order to correct them I should have to
rewrite the book—and in the process of rewriting, as an older, other
person, I should probably get rid not only of some of the faults of
the story, but also of such merits as it originally possessed. And so, resisting the temptation to wallow in artistic remorse, I prefer to
leave both well and ill alone and to think about something else." </h3></div>

<div class="content">
<p>"Old classics are still the best. In those days, they had culture, and moral values, and...and integrity."</p>
<p>-We the Living, by Ayn Rand</p>
<p>While value can be found in almost any book, there is something special about classics. They have stood the test of time. Despite the changes the world has gone through since their publication, due to their universal themes and beautiful language, these books continue to captivate the minds and hearts of millions of individuals.</p>

 <p>"You're already off to a great start, reading the quote, learning about the author, finding out the context of the book, diving into the themes, and glancing at the meaning. You have done that, right? In all seriousness, there are a couple ways you could further study this."</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Keep an eye out for any words you don't know or don't understand the usage of.</li>
		<li>Look for rhetorical devices, and understand why they were used.</li>
