needed there at all. No scope for your talents: only forgiveness for having perverted them. No
atmosphere of inquiry, for I will bring you to the land not of questions but of answers, and you
shall see the face of God." </h3></div>

  <h3 id="myText">"They say of some temporal suffering, 'No future bliss can make up for it,'
not knowing that Heaven, once attained, will work backwards and turn even that agony into a
glory. And of some sinful pleasure they say 'Let me but have this and I'll take the consequences':
little dreaming how damnation will spread back and back into their past and contaminate the
pleasure of the sin. Both processes begin even before death. The good man's past begins to change
so that hisforgiven sins and remembered sorrows take on the quality of Heaven: the bad man's past
already conforms to his badness and is filled only with dreariness." </h3></div>

  <h3 id="myText">"There are only two kinds of people in the end: those
who say to God, 'Thy will be done,' and those to whom God says, in the end, 'Thy will be done.' All
that are in Hell, choose it. Without that self-choice there could be no Hell. No soul that seriously
and constantly desires joy will ever miss it. Those who seek find. To those who knock it is opened." </h3></div>

  <h3 id="myText">"And yet all loneliness, angers, hatreds, envies and itchings that it contains, if rolled into one single
experience and put into the scale against the least moment of the joy that is felt by the least in
Heaven, would have no weight that could be registered at all. Bad cannot succeed even in being
bad as truly as good is good. If all Hell's miseries together entered the consciousness of yon wee
yellow bird on the bough there, they would be swallowed up without trace, as if one drop of ink
had been dropped into that Great Ocean to which your terrestrial Pacific itself is only a molecule." </h3></div>
