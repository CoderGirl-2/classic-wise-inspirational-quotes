  <div class="content-to-copy">
  <p id="myText"><b><font size="5">But in the intellectual climate which we have at last succeeded in producing throughout Western Europe, you needn't bother about that. Only the learned read old books and we have now so dealt with the learned that they are of all men the least likely to acquire wisdom by doing so. We have done this by inculcating The Historical Point of View. The Historical Point of View, put briefly, means that when a learned man is presented with any statement in an ancient author, the one question he never asks is whether it is true...to regard the ancient writer as a possible source of knowledge — to anticipate that what he said could possibly modify your thoughts or your behaviour — this would be rejected as unutterably simple-minded."</font></b></p>

    <h2>Daily Ramble</h2>
	  	<p>This quote isn't just still relevant. It's more relevant. People ignore  older books, with claims such as "they weren't as enlightened" or "this can't apply anymore, the world has changed too much" This, of course, is incredibly narrow-minded and frankly presumptous.  While yes, older minds didn't have quite the grasp on things like science and mathematics as we do today, and yes, our world seems so much different, this doesn't effect whether we should read these books or not. Truth hasn't changed. There was good and evil 1000 years ago, there is today, and there will be 1000 years from now. Observations on beauty, love, passion, friendship, family, faith- these remain applicable and educational to ours lives to our lives today. But only if we choose to humble ourselves, and to lean our ear to the older voices.</p>

<div class="content">
<p>"Old classics are still the best. In those days, they had culture, and moral values, and...and integrity."</p>
<p>-We the Living, by Ayn Rand</p>
<p>While value can be found in almost any book, there is something special about classics. They have stood the test of time. Despite the changes the world has gone through since their publication, due to their universal themes and beautiful language, these books continue to captivate the minds and hearts of millions of individuals.</p>

      <button type="button" class="collapsible"><h3>How can I study this further?▼</h3></button>
<div class="content">
 <p>"You're already off to a great start, reading the quote, learning about the author, finding out the context of the book, diving into the themes, and glancing at the meaning. You have done that, right? In all seriousness, there are a couple ways you could further study this."</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Keep an eye out for any words you don't know or don't understand the usage of.</li>
		<li>Look for rhetorical devices, and understand why they were used.</li>
