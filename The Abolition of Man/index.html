  <h3>"The Chinese also speak of a great thing (the greatest thing) called the Tao. It is the
reality beyond all predicates, the abyss that was before the Creator Himself. It is
Nature, it is the Way, the Road. It is the Way in which the universe goes on, the
Way in which things everlastingly emerge, stilly and tranquilly, into space and
time. It is also the Way which every man should tread in imitation of that cosmic
and supercosmic progression, conforming all activities to that great exemplar" </h3></div>

subjected to some individual men, and those individuals subjected to that in
themselves which is purely `natural'—to their irrational impulses. Nature,
untrammelled by values, rules the Conditioners and, through them, all humanity.
Man's conquest of Nature turns out, in the moment of its consummation, to be
Nature's conquest of Man." </h3></div>
