      <button type="button" class="collapsible">Why Classic Books?▼</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>"Old classics are still the best. In those days, they had culture, and moral values, and...and integrity."</p>
<p>-We the Living, by Ayn Rand</p>

      <button type="button" class="collapsible">How can I study this further?▼</button>
<div class="content">
 <p>"You're already off to a great start, reading the quote, learning about the author, finding out the context of the book, diving into the themes, and glancing at the meaning. You have done that, right? In all seriousness, there are a couple ways you could further study this."</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Keep an eye out for any words you don't know or don't understand the usage of.</li>
		<li>Look for rhetorical devices, and understand why they were used.</li>
		<li>Try to paraphrase it, or simply explain it. Through this, you'll discover the areas of the quote you don't understand. This is where you should do further research. </li>
		<li>Read the book. Often classics are available fore free on websites like <a href="https://gutenberg.org/">Project Gutenberg</a> or <a href="https://books.google.com/">Google Books</a>/></li>

  <button type="button" class="collapsible">Why do you have Athena and Calliope up there? And what's with the logo?▼</button>
<div class="content">
 <p>A common understanding of Greek gods and goddesses is that they are personified ideals or passions. This makes abstract concepts simpler to understand. I rather like this idea, so I included it in the website. Athena was labeled the goddess of wisdom, so having her image is a simple way to "show" wisdom. Calliope, on the other hand, was the goddess of inspiration. In fact, they both are secretly included in the logo. The owl is the symbol of Athena, and the scroll is the symbol of Calliope.</p>
