  <div class="content-to-copy">
  <p id="myText"><b><font size="5">"Can external freedom for its own sake be the goal of conscious living beings? Or is it only a framework within which other and higher aims can be realized? We are creatures born with inner freedom of will, freedom of choice -the most important part of freedom is a gift to us at birth. External, or social, freedom is very desirable for the sake of undistorted growth, but it is no more than a condition, a medium, and to regard it as the object of our existence is nonsense. We can firmly assert our inner freedom even in external conditions of unfreedom. (Remember how Dostoyevsky ridicules the complaint that "our environment has destroyed us.") In an unfree environment we do not lose the possibility of progress toward moral goals (that for instance of leaving this earth better men than our hereditary endowment has made us). The need to struggle against our surroundings rewards our effort with greater inner success."</font></b></p>

    <h2>Daily Ramble</h2>
	  	<p>Despite our external freedom or lack there of, out internal freedom remains OUR OWN. It cannot be taken away from us. While external freedom does offer greater oppurtunity for "higher aims to he realized", we remain responsible for our inner freedom. This means despite the pain and contraint of our external conditions, we must utilize our inner freedom and use it to advance the good. </p>
