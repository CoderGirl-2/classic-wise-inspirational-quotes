  <h3>"It is precisely here that we find the origins of the 
radical division of Christian life into two independent 
spheres, the ecclesiastical and the sociohistorical...And that greatest of all temptations began to rear its 
head — that of “simplifying” Christianity, of reducing it from 
being a teaching about the new life to a mere caring for the 
salvation of one’s own soul. As a result of this, the earthly 
aspect of life and the whole structure of social relations 
turned out to be empty and immune to the influence of the 
truth." </h3></div>

world completely without God. Although proud of its suc- 
cesses and attainments, the world sees every day more 
clearly the provisional and insufficient nature of its civiliza- 
tion. On the verge of having its foundations shaken to the 
core, it thirsts as never before for the true light." </h3></div>
