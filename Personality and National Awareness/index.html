  <h3>"During recent decades many people have come to understand a long known but eternally neglected truth: that a 
people can perish without being totally annihilated 
physically — it is necessary only to remove its memory, its 
thought and its word, and the soul of the people will die. 
History may observe the numbing spectacle of the dead and 
soulless body’s continued growth for a long time afterward, 
but eventually it witnesses the predestined collapse." </h3></div>

  <h3>"In breaking the link between the human personality and 
the absolute source of its rights, and yet affirming them as 
something to be taken for granted, rationalist humanism has 
from the very outset been inherently inconsistent, as its more 
logical successors very quickly understood. Darwin, Marx, 
Nietzsche and Freud (and many others) resolved the inconsistency each in his own way, leaving not one stone upon 
another in the edifice of blind faith in man’s dignity. They 
knocked the human personality off its phantom humanist 
pedestal, tore off and ridiculed its mantle of sanctity and inviolacy, and showed it its true station in life — as the cobblestone paving the road for “superman,” or the drop of water 
destined with millions of others to irrigate the historical soil 
for the happiness of future generations, or the lump of flesh 
dragging itself painfully and uncomprehendingly to union 
with its fellows." </h3></div>

  <h3>"This sense of the nation as a personality, which has been 
expressed by individuals, corresponds with and confirms the 
people’s awareness of its identity as embodied in folklore. Its 
image covertly governs our speech, for when we speak of the 
“dignity” of the people, its “duty,” its “sins” or its “responsibility,” we are making concrete, that is to say, unmetaphorical, use of terms that are applicable only to the moral life of a 
person." </h3></div>
