  <h3>"But the chief justifying argument is: children! In the face 
of this argument everyone falls silent: for who has the right to 
sacrifice the material welfare of his children for the sake of an 
abstract principle of truth?!...(On the contrary) Let my children grow up on a 
crust of bread, so long as they are honest." </h3></div>

  <h3>"Nobody is foisting “culture” on us, it is lies they are foisting 
upon us and it is only lies that we must not accept, but at 
once, right then and right there where we are being asked to 
accept them, instead of venting our indignation later in the 
evening over the tea table at home. We must reject lies on 
the spot, without thinking about the consequences for our 
salaries, our families and our leisure for spreading the “new 
culture.” We must reject lies without worrying whether 
others will follow in our footsteps and without looking 
around to see if the rest of the population is catching the 
habit. " </h3></div>

consist of human beings, and there is no way in which the future can be closed to human beings: human beings determine their future themselves, and whatever point has been 
reached on the crooked, descending path, it is never too late 
to take a turn for the good and the better." </h3></div>

  <h3>"Because in our country the daily lie is not the 
whim of corrupt natures but a mode of existence, a condition 
of the daily welfare of every man. In our country the lie has 
been incorporated into the state system as the vital link holding everything together, with billions of tiny fasteners, several dozen to each man. This is precisely why we find life so oppressive. But it is 
also precisely why we should find it natural to straighten up. 
When oppression is not accompanied by the lie, liberation 
demands political measures. But when the lie has fastened 
its claws in us, it is no longer a matter of politics! It is an invasion of man’s moral world, and our straightening up and 
refusing to lie is also not political, but simply the retrieval of 
our human dignity." </h3></div>
