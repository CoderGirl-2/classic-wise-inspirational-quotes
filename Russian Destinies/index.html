  <h3>"But if you have not yet realized this, what are 
you to do when it is considered normal to pour abuse on all 
that is holy, and the savagery and corruption permeating our 
society are thought merely matters for political and philosophical speculation? What are you to do when you and your 
people seem to have come to the limit of human endurance, 
when you find yourself facing a blank wall that looms in front 
of you and stops all light from reaching you, when your 
knocking cannot be heard, when your cries are stifled as if by 
cotton wool, when you are already prepared to end it all, to 
die, even though you realize quite clearly the senselessness 
of self-immolation?" </h3></div>

of an evil power, a fatal combination of circumstances or 
merely proof of the ambition, cruelty and pettiness of those 
in power, the stupidity and savagery of the men who for 
some incomprehensible reason existed around you — all this 
is unexpectedly illumined by the lofty concept of Destiny." </h3></div>
