  <h3>"So, among the principles which are present in many unconnected socialist states or present-day movements and 
which can therefore be attributed to the basic premises of socialism, are: the abolition of private property, the destruction of religion, the destruction of the family. Socialism 
appears before us not as a purely economic concept, but as an 
incomparably wider system of views, embracing almost every 
aspect of human existence. " </h3></div>

  <h3>"The idea of human 
equality is also fundamental to religion, but it is achieved in 
contact with God, that is, in the highest sphere of human ex- 
istence. Socialism, as is clearly evident from the examples 
above, aims to establish equality by the opposite means of 
destroying all the higher aspects of the personality. It is this 
concept of equality to which the socialist principles of com- 
munal property and the destruction of the family relate, and 
it also explains the hatred of religion which saturates social- 
ist ideology. " </h3></div>
