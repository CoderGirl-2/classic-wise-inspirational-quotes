  <h3>"...and it is Christianity that is the fermenting 
agent, the “yeast of the world,” causing history to rise like 
dough in a trough, not only in the past but in the future as well. We are profoundly convinced that Christianity alone

violence, to the point of laying down our lives if necessary. 
And this transformation must take place within our souls." </h3></div>
