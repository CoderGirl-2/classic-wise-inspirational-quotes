Freedom is a very desirable gift, but, like any sort of freedom,
a gift of conditional, not intrinsic, worth, only a means by
which we can attain another and higher god." </h3></div>

  <h3>"Can eternal freedom for its own sake be the goal of conscious living beings? Or is it only a framework within which
other and higher aims can be realized? We are creatures born with inner freedom of will, freedom of choice -the most important part of freedom is a gift to us at birth. External, or
social, freedom is very desirable for the sake of undistorted
growth, but it is no more than a condition, a medium, and to
regard it as the object of our existence is nonsense. We can
firmly assert our inner freedom even in external conditions of
unfreedom. (Remember how Dostoyevsky ridicules the complaint that "our environment has destroyed us.") In an unfit,ee
environment we do not lose the possibility of progress and moral goals (that for instance of leaving this earth better
men than our hereditary endowment has made us). The need
to struggle against our surroundings rewards our efforts with greater inner success." </h3></div>

  <h3>"It would be more correct to say that in relation to the true ends of human beings here on earth (and these cannot be
equated with the aims of the animal world, which amount to
no more than unhindered existence) the state structure is of
secondary significance. That this is so, Christ himself teaches
us. "Render unto Caesar what is Caesar's- not because every Caesar deserves it, but because Caesar's concern is not
with the most important thing in our lives." </h3></div>

  <h3>"Our present system is unique in world history, because 
over and above its physical and economic constraints, it de- 
mands of us total surrender of our souls, continuous and ac- 
tive participation in the general, conscious lie. To this 
putrefaction of the soul, this spiritual enslavement, human beings who wish to be human cannot consent. When Caesar, 
having exacted what is Caesar’s, demands still more insistently that we render unto him what is God’s — that is a sacrifice we dare not make! 
The most important part of our freedom, inner freedom, is 
always subject to our will. If we surrender it to corruption, 
we do not deserve to be called human." </h3></div>
