you really believe anything until its truth or falsehood becomes a matter of
life and death to you. It is easy to say you believe a rope to be strong and
sound as long as you are merely using it to cord a box. But suppose you
had to hang by that rope over a precipice...Only a real risk tests the reality of a belief." </h3></div>

  <h3>"But suppose that what you are up against is a surgeon whose 
intentions are wholly good. The kinder and more conscientious he is, the
more inexorably he will go on cutting. If he yielded to your entreaties, if he
stopped before the operation was complete, all the pain up to that point
would have been useless. But is it credible that such extremities of torture
should be necessary for us? Well, take your choice. The tortures occur. If
they are unnecessary, then there is no God or a bad one. If there is a good
God, then these tortures are necessary. For no even moderately good Being
could possibly inflict or permit them if they weren't." </h3></div>

  <h3>"There is, hidden or flaunted, a
sword between the sexes till an entire marriage reconciles them. It is
arrogance in us to call frankness, fairness, and chivalry 'masculine' when
we see them in a woman; it is arrogance in them, to describe a man's
sensitiveness or tact or tenderness as 'feminine.' But also what poor,
warped fragments of humanity most mere men and mere women must be
to make the implications of that arrogance plausible. Marriage heals this.
Jointly the two become fully human. 'In the image of God created He them.'
Thus, by a paradox, this carnival of sexuality leads us out beyond our
sexes." </h3></div>

writing that history at some quite arbitrary point, there's no reason why I
should ever stop. There is something new to be chronicled every day. Grief
is like a long valley, a winding valley where any bend may reveal a totally
new landscape. " </h3></div>
