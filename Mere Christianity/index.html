though it makes evil possible, is also the only thing that makes possible any love or goodness or joy
worth having. A world of automata—of creatures that worked like machines—would hardly be worth
creating. The happiness which God designs for His higher creatures is the happiness of being freely,
voluntarily united to Him and to each other in an ecstasy of love and delight compared with which the
most rapturous love between a man and a woman on this earth is mere milk and water. And for that
they must be free." </h3></div>
